      <h1>About Harnoor Kaur</h1>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Harnoor Kaur</strong>, a data-driven Business Analyst based in Canada. I specialize in delivering actionable insights that empower businesses to make informed decisions. With a strong foundation in data analysis, project management, and stakeholder communication, I help organizations navigate their most pressing challenges with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey began with a curiosity for how businesses grow. That curiosity led me to explore the world of analytics and business intelligence. I’ve since developed expertise in tools like <strong>Power BI, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python</strong> to uncover trends, identify gaps, and streamline operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe great analysis goes beyond numbers. It's about asking the right questions, aligning with strategic goals, and delivering solutions that create long-term value. Whether it's mapping processes, building dashboards, or writing clear business cases, I bring clarity and precision to every step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy exploring cultures, reading non-fiction, and learning new languages. My approach is rooted in curiosity, empathy, and adaptability—traits that help me thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments.
